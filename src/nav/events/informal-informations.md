## Abstract

Para academic, under-common gathering. Places and spaces for thinking-feeling and feeling-thinking space and place. Thoughtful collectives of makers and making thought collective. Community engagement without the BS PR hustle. Social practice with more logistics. Architectural scale organizational sustainability without the death anxiety.

What works? What doesnâ€™t? What are the hard problems ? What are the inspirations?
