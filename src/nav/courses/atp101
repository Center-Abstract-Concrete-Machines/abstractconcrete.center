# A Thousand Plateaus 101: Studies for Practice, Practices for Study

The reputation of the second co-written text by activist philosopher and clinical psychologist Felix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze truly precedes it. On the one hand, the work has been deried as obtuse and esoteric and accused of misusing concepts borrowed from scientific disciplines. On the other, it continues to serve artists, writers, and scholars as a wellspring of generative and provocative concepts and affects almost half a century after its publication. The rhizomatic image of thought, the body without organs, and the virtual pockmark many artist descriptions, literary criticisms, and even business management scholarship. D&G's characterization of philosophy as the creation of concepts make it a clear friend to artists wishing to deepen their work's intellectual project.

In this seminar, we will spend eight weeks progressing through the text

This course is for both true beginners of philosophy and Deleuze and Guattari as well as those with a beginner spirit who can approach the text with freshness.
and Deleuze's characterization of philosophy as a "tool box", we will resist picking the text book up as a manual

We will spend time in class practicing close reading, which allows the text to stand on its own before it is made useful elsewhere.
