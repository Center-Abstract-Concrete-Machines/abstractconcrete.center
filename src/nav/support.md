CCAM is seeking not-for-profit status. As an extra-institutional organization, it relies on fundraising and donations to maintain a physical space, to pay for organizational labor, and provide resources to artists in their continuing education and residency opportunities.

## Financial donations

Financial donations are graciously accepted, but as of publication of this page, we are not currently a 501(c)(3) and so they have no tax deductible status. We hope to ammend that soon -- even applying for 501(c)(3) costs money though!

## Equipment and Books donations

We graciously accept donations of equipment related to the sonic and responsive media arts. Some currently needs are:

- whiteboards
- folding chairs and tables
- pen plotter
- risographic duplicator
- B/W or color laser printer
- soldering irons & helping hands, other soldering supplies
- speakers & amplifiers
- misc. eurorack components (power supplies, rackmounts, etc.)
- projectors, LCD screens
- (modern, 5 years or more recent) PCs, Macs, desktops, laptops
- 3D printers, other CNCs

## Time Donations

Our most valueable resource. As we soft launch, much of CCAM runs on a labor of love. If you have an idea for programming that shares your perspective and skillset, please reach out via our contact page.
