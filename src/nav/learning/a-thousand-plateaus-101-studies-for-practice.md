## extended description

In this 8-session course, we will work through key sections of A Thousand Plateaus. CCAM's selection of ATP as the basis of their first seminar is not incidental. Indeed, Deleuze once wrote "where to begin in philosophy has always - rightly - been regarded as a very delicate problem"[0]. The text models creative inquiry or inquiring creation that is unapologetically non-deferential to creativity or inquiry. This deep transdisciplinarity is borne out in myriad scholars and artists who have taken up the arrows shot by Deleuze and Guattari [1]. D&G's characterization of philosophy as the creation of concepts make it a clear friend to artists, designers, musicians, and dancers wishing to deepen their work's intellectual project. Crosswise, it affords the possibility for creative impulse (what Brian Massumi calls the "shock to thought") to writers and humanists. In short, we will pursue what it means to generate theoretical studies for practice as well as practices for study.

This course will be conducted for both true beginners of philosophy and Deleuze and Guattari as well for those returning to the text with a beginner spirit. Deleuze also characterized philosophy not as a guidebook but as a "tool box". In this sense we will learn and practice expressive techniques of some of these conceptual tools. With an eye for safety we will heed Deleuze and Guattari's many caveats. Practiced in and outside of class, a crucial outcome of the course will be facility with close reading. Close reading can be understood as an analytic, reflective, and discursive practice that seeks understanding of how the text's machines of thought work -- before plugging them into our own machines to make them useful elsewhere.

A Thousand Plateaus, the second co-written text by activist philosopher and clinical psychologist Felix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze, is a wild text representing the sustained collaboration of two very different and seemingly incompatible minds. Before meeting Guattari, Deleuze's work was characterized as rigorous yet provocative readings of the history of philosophy, in which he would "take a philosopher from behind and give them a child they wouldn't recognize". Guattari was an activist and psychoanalyst working clinically and experimentally at La Borde, a Parasian countryside for schizophrenics. Guattari, always keen for gathering and connecting ensembles of philosophers, activists, and thinkers, was recruited by Delueze into this truly unique dyadic thinking-making machine.

This class is an intro to deep transdisciplinarity: Deleuze and Guattari's four collaborative texts represent their omnivorous and insatiable appetite for systems of thought and practice as well as, traversing and careen through discplinary walls, including art, classical and electronic music, literature, biology, psychoanalysis, thermodynamics, topological mathematics, linguistics and semiotics, theatre, physics, cybernetics, computation, film and cinema, and politics to name a few.

The reputation truly precedes it. On the one hand, the work has been deried as obtuse and esoteric and accused of misusing concepts borrowed from scientific disciplines. On the other, it continues to serve artists, writers, and scholars as a wellspring of generative and provocative concepts and affects almost half a century after its publication. The rhizomatic image of thought, the line of flight, becoming-woman, the body without organs, the assemblage, and the virtual pockmark many artist descriptions, literary criticisms, and even business management scholarship. Familiar concepts such as the refrain, territory, and chaos take on dynamic meanings in Deleuze and Guattari's far-from-equilibrium systems of thought.

## Instructor Bio

Garrett Laroy Johnson first read the Rhizome in 2015 and fell into it. Since, Deleuze and Guattari have come to very different things in his work. He has a deep appreciation for how the text reveals new puzzles, riddles, and mysteries as others are unlocked. For Garrett, the text's most important imperative is how to make the text useful in their media art research practice.
