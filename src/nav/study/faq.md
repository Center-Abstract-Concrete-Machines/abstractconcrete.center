# LEARNING FAQ

Some questions or anticipated questions.

#### Q: Are any of your course offerings accredited?

A: No. We are not seeking accreditation of any kind. There are no degrees, no tokenized achievement.

#### Q: What are the fees for?

A: The fees help to pay our instructors for their labor and maintain our physical space. They may also pay for materials related to the course. Sometimes specific offerings are subsidized by grants, and sometimes there are competitive TA awards after an enrollment threshold has been met.

#### Q: What is the application process?

A: Since there are no prerequisites, we use the application to make sure people are a good fit for the course and the level at which the course will move. This also helps us to get a sense of interest before the end of the application period.
