            <p>Weird Dreams, Weird Analysis is a new transdisciplinary arts and humanities collaborative project gathering creative practitioners in the arts, theory, and technology from different continents and professional contexts to speculate on the political potentials of the Weird as an aesthetic category and new modes of (psycho-schizo)analysis sufficient to it.
            </p>
            <p>In 2023-2025, we will gather and share our work in symposia, group exhibitions, and experimental web and physical publications.</p>

            <p>
              It’s not so much that we’ve lost the ability to dream, but that
              our dreams have become so alien that we do not recognize them as
              our own. Or that if those are our dreams, then we must be
              somewhere else than we thought we were.
            </p>
            <p>
              One part art exhibition, one part therapeutics, and one part
              research seminar, one part analysis, Weird Dreams, Weird Analysis
              uses the idea of the “weird” to chart novel aesthetic, political,
              and epistemological dimensions of subject formation and
              objecthood. For instance, Bifo Berardi demarcates a phase change
              in the history of the unconscious that’s been churning since Web
              2.0. With the pandemic, we pass through another psychic threshold.
              These days, we are confused by the vectors of desire and its
              sublimations: nascent tendencies toward interiority balance
              against “extremely online” hyper expressivity, going goblin mode
              disintegrates into self-flagellating doom-scrolling, a lockdown
              induced transformation of sexuality and corporeality alongside a
              blooming of depressive anxiety, “rise and grind” fading to “quiet
              quitting”.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we aren’t where we thought we are, we must ask not only where
              do we dream of going from here, but also: how is it that we got
              here? How can transdisciplinary approaches to art, psyche,
              ecology, body, and technology help us dream weirdly enough to
              generate subjectivities sufficient to the challenges of climate
              change, infrastructural collapse, and social upheaval?
            </p>
            <p>
              Distinct from the unheimlich, Mark Fisher writes about the weird
              as an encounter that makes us feel that “something is there that
              shouldn’t be”. The weird is not just something that doesn’t make
              sense, it is a recognition that there is too much sense, or too
              many ways to make sense for a specific moment. The weird creates
              portals to the outside that remind us that even when we are alone,
              we are not by ourselves. And even when we are here, we are also
              somehow somewhere else. We intend to explore weird dreams by
              asking how weird and adjacent aesthetics of the new (techno,
              cyberpunk) and the old (goth, metal, tradcath) grapple with deeply
              sedimented conservatism and colonial hatred while fashioning
              instruments for receiving and interpreting messages from above the
              clouds?
            </p>

            <p>
              Following psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi’s transdisciplinary
              analytic method ultraquistics and Felix Guattari’s indisciplined
              diagrammatics, weird analysis necessitates disciplinary
              concoctions that refuse to integrate, find a solution, or create a
              hybrid. Drawing on heterodox traditions of psychoanalysis, the
              practical, experiential, and aesthetic dimensions of this
              collaborative project are indispensable. To this end, Weird
              Dreams, Weird Analysis gathers a transdisciplinary array of
              artists, makers, designers, and theorists.
